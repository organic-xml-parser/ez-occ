# CAD UI Framework

## Session

The entities to be rendered/interacted with are stored in a Session. Changes to the session
can be listened for to update elements accordingly

## VTK

Visualization is accomplished with a VTK renderer. Actors are created to represent the
vertex, edge, and face collections of the objects in the scene. Therefore each part
is associated with 3 actors.

### VTK basics

To create an actor in a VTK scene, the following are assembled roughly in order:

- data source, e.g. vtkPlaneSource, vtkPolyData, (subclasses of vtkPolyDataAlgorithm??)
- vtkPolyDataMapper -> data_mapper.SetInputData(input_data) / SetInputConnection
- vtkActor -> actor.SetMapper(data_mapper)

vtk source -> vtk poly data mapper -> vtk actor


## VTK - OCC

The association between the VTK and OCC entites is tracked via VtkOccActorMap.
This map is generated by VtkActorCollectionBuilder, currently the SessionFrame
owning the VTK visualization component is responsible for rebuilding this map
when changes to the session are made.
