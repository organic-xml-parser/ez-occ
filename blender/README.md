# Exporting scenes to Blender

Use SceneUtils#saveSTls / SceneUtils#saveKeyframes to a dedicated output directory.
Then use launch_blender_with_vis_script to create the scene objects, along with any keyframes 
to apply to them.

This will give you a fully animated scene with objects ready to be rendered. You can then 
apply any visualizations you want to them.
